# Laravel-Usps

This package provides a very simple wrapper for the United States Postal Service API. Currently, this package only provides address verification features, but will soon comprise all features offered by the USPS API. In the meantime, consider using [johnpaulmedina/laravel-usps](https://github.com/johnpaulmedina/laravel-usps), which is a great package.

### Prerequisites

Be sure to register at [www.usps.com/webtools/](www.usps.com/webtools/) to receive your unique user ID
from the United States Postal Service. This user ID is required to use this package.

### Install
